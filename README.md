# Dirt simple StDC project spec:
v0.1 Nov 4 2017

*Copy this spec to start a new argo-marketplace project*

- SEEKERS: Usually a public institution that is seeking tech talent to address a need or solve a problem.
- SOLVERS: Public Technologists who mostly agree with a [Manifesto for public technology](civichall.org/civicist/manifesto-for-public-technology/)
- ARGO: A non-profit organization that shepherds the ARGO marketplace. Contact argo@argolabs.org if questions.

# Define Purpose 

- **Why are we doing this project? What specific problem are we addressing?**
	- *Describe the problem in a few sentences.*
	- *Specify short and long-term needs that provide context for this problem.*
- **What is this ?** 
	- *Is it an algorithm, a visualization, a parser, a scraper, a simulation, a map?*
	- *Provide some additional details to help solvers.*
- **Possible methods.**
	- *Have you tried any methods previously? Did they succeed, fail?*
	- *Improvements to existing methods?*
- **Ideal outcome of a solution?**
	- *If this problem is solved, how do you envision this is scaled up to cover a citywide strategy.*
- **Some lit. review or.addl resources.**
	- *Links to news articles or research papers to help a potential solver or a google doc providing extended explanations.*

# Define Process

- If a SOLVER needs to ask a question, they open a [new issue](https://github.com/argo-marketplace/test-project/issues) and label it appropriately. It is highly recommended that SEEKERs commit to answering questions and close issues in a timely manner.
- SEEKERs may also open issues and leave it open to simulate a FAQ
- SOLVERS are encouraged to for a project repo and issue pull requests once they have prepared a solution that is fully executable and readable.
- ARGO and SEEKERS will collaborate to update the repo with content that is deemed useful to SOLVERs.

# Suggested repo folders
- `Data`
	- *Contains datasets provided by SEEKERS to help SOLVERS*

- `Research/Literature`
	- *A place to upload research papers, news articles or additional literature review to help SOLVERS better understand the scope of the problem and provide as much context as possible. This should ideally be maintained by SEEKERS but SOLVERS may also contribute.*

- `Source`
	- *This is a place for both SOLVERS and SEEKERS. This folder or sub-folder(s) can contain **readable & executable code**, Tableau workbooks etc.
